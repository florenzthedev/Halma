# Halma
The Halma board game.

Two or four player implementation of the board game Halma written in plain C. Should work on any terminal that supports color.

To build run `make` and then to run the result use `./halma`.
The makefile also has a `make run` command that runs the built executable in a new gnome terminal window, useful for working with IDEs.
